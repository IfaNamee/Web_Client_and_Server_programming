Which one do you prefer? Why?
    I preferred Vue.js since it is simple to code and develop. 
    It simplifies complex procedures, speeds development, and offers 
    a structured method to managing components and state. It’s extremely 
    especially valuable for projects that demand scalability, reactivity,
     or regular updates.
